# Deep RL: Atari

The files ```train.py``` and ```trainBayes.py``` can be used to train a CNN and BNN Q-learning agent respectivly, and the CNN code resides in the file ```model.py```.

The folders plot_CNN and plot_BNN contain the rewards and losses recorded during the training process of both agents among other log files. The files ```plot_BNN/bayes_clipped_log.npy``` and ```plot_CNN/logs/clipped_log.npy``` are the ones containing the rewards ploted by the 2 ```plot.py``` scripts in their respective folders.
